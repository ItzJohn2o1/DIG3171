# My Final Research Project  

This is a big project, and you definitely want a place to show it off! Here's a suggested layout for that (but feel free to display your work however you prefer).
You can link to your project here, or embed it.
If it is easier to embed your project in an HTML file, just change the .md on this one to .html, and write in HTML! (Be sure to update the links to this page to reflect the new name though!)

# Abstract

Methods
To quantify and analyze the homogeneity of AI-generated versus human-created content, this study employs Voyant Tools, a web-based text analysis platform. Voyant provides computational methods for examining large bodies of text, enabling systematic comparison of linguistic patterns, thematic convergence, and lexical diversity.

The methodology consists of three primary phases:

1. Data Collection: I will compile two corpora—one containing AI-generated texts (produced by large language models such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini) and another containing human-authored texts on comparable topics. Both corpora will include academic writing, creative content, and analytical essays to ensure breadth of comparison.

2. Text Analysis with Voyant: Using Voyant's suite of analytical tools, I will examine:
• Word frequency and distribution patterns to identify overused phrases and predictable language structures
• Term clusters and collocations to reveal thematic convergence
• Lexical density and vocabulary richness metrics to measure linguistic diversity
• Distinctive words analysis to identify unique versus common terminology
• Trends and patterns across document segments to assess consistency versus variation

3. Comparative Analysis: The metrics derived from Voyant will be used to compare the two corpora quantitatively. Key indicators of homogenization include lower lexical diversity scores, higher repetition rates of specific terms, and reduced syntactic structure variation within the AI corpus compared to the human corpus.

This computational approach allows for objective, data-driven assessment of linguistic homogeneity. By visualizing patterns through Voyant's interactive tools (such as word clouds, scatter plots, and frequency charts), the study will provide concrete evidence of how AI-generated content may exhibit more uniformity than human-created work. These findings will support the hypothesis that reliance on generative AI contributes to intellectual homogenization and may diminish the diversity of creative and analytical expression.
